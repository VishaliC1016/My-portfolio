    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="C:/Users/vishali/OneDrive/Pictures/DSC_0204a-transformed.jpeg" alt="Vishali">
    <p>
       My name is Vishali C.I am a recent graduate from Sri Sairam Engineering College, where I completed my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a CGPA of 8.44. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong passion for coding and designing websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am proficient in several programming languages, including Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages not only form the foundation of my technical expertise but also serve as tools for me to turn my ideas into reality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coding is not just a skill for me, but a form of creative expression. I enjoy the process of bringing ideas to life through clean and efficient code. Whether it's solving complex problems, building interactive web applications, or designing intuitive user interfaces, I thrive on the challenges that programming presents.
    </p>
<p>
        Additionally, I have a solid understanding of data analytics and visualization tools, particularly Power BI. I attended a Data Analytics course from ICT Academy's Women Empowerment program, where I gained hands-on experience with Power BI. This training equipped me with the skills to analyze data, create insightful visualizations, and derive meaningful insights to drive informed decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not immersed in coding or data analysis, you can find me exploring new design trends, experimenting with different programming languages, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in the power of continuous learning and strive to stay updated with the latest advancements in the ever-evolving world of technology.
    </p>
<p>
        Additionally, I have gained valuable industry experience through internships. At Ifortis World Wide, I served as a Corporate Ambassador, where I learned sales and marketing techniques and honed my interpersonal and communication skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        During my internship at Cisco in Cybersecurity, I delved into networking concepts as part of the Cybersecurity Fundamentals program. This experience provided me with a solid foundation in cybersecurity and networking principles.
    </p>
<p>
    Moreover, I have pursued various certifications to enhance my skills and knowledge. I have completed the following Coursera courses:
    <ul>
            <li><a href="https://coursera.org/share/95f0bfc3122a3deab600128ba693fb5b" target="_blank">Google Cloud Fundamentals Infrastructure</a></li>

        </ul></p>
    <p>
        My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills and expertise to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact on people's lives. I am excited about the endless possibilities that the world of technology offers and look forward to contributing my part to shaping the future.

        <h3>Recognizing Eminent Players from Indian Premier League</h3>
        <p>
            For this project, I developed a system to identify and rank the top 20 players in the Indian Premier League (IPL) using sentiment analysis of tweets collected from Twitter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project involved collecting tweets related to IPL from Twitter's API and performing sentiment analysis using TextBlob for Python. Tweets were categorized into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments using data processing techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implemented with Python's Django framework, I built a model to rank the players based on the sentiment of tweets mentioning them. The CNN model was trained on the sentiment-labeled tweet data to identify the most prominent players based on positive sentiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project not only showcased my skills in natural language processing and machine learning but also demonstrated the practical application of sentiment analysis in determining the popularity and perception of players in a sports context.
        </p>

    <h3>Emer-Smart: Emergency Alert System</h3>
    <p>
        Emer-Smart is an innovative emergency alert application designed to enhance residential security and safety. Leveraging advanced technology, including the ESP32-CAM microcontroller and doorbell sensor, Emer-Smart provides real-time monitoring and alerts residents in case of suspicious activity or potential threats.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system operates by continuously monitoring the surroundings using the doorbell sensor. When the sensor detects abnormal activity, such as unauthorized entry or suspicious movement, it triggers the ESP32-CAM to capture images or videos of the event.
    </p>
    <p>
        Upon capturing the evidence, Emer-Smart sends an immediate alert to the residents via email, providing them with crucial information about the incident. This prompt notification empowers residents to take appropriate actions, such as contacting authorities or alerting neighbors, to mitigate potential risks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Emer-Smart's integration of cutting-edge technology with proactive security measures makes it an invaluable asset for residential communities, offering peace of mind and enhanced protection against thefts and intrusions.
